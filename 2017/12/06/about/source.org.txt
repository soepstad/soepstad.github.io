Â A bit too much "great man"-ing of Churchill at times, and the first
part is basically two separate short biographies intertwined with a
shallow history of the war-to-war era. The final part is the most
interesting, when Ricks gets more into their overlapping ideas and the
legacy of those ideas. He could very well have spent more time on this
and less on the generic biographies.

 Audio: James Lurie has the perfect voice for a book such as this,
 somber and works well at 1.5x speed.
